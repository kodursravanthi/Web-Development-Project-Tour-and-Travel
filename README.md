# Web-Development-Project-Tour-and-Travel
The Tour and Travel Website is a dynamic and user-friendly platform designed to help users explore, plan, and book their travel experiences online. It provides detailed information about tourist destinations, travel packages. The project aims to simplify travel planning by offering an interactive interface, attractive visuals, and easy navigation.
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end design, with optional integration of backend technologies (like PHP/MySQL) for booking management and user accounts. The project emphasizes a responsive layout, ensuring smooth functionality across devices such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
